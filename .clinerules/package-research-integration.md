## Brief overview
This rule establishes a systematic approach for researching and integrating third-party packages using MCP tools, with a focus on Context7 for documentation, Exa Search for use case understanding, and Knowledge Graph Memory for long-term retention of package knowledge.

## Research methodology
  - Always start with Context7 MCP server to research third-party packages when beginning a new task
  - Research should include: quick start information, integration patterns with other packages, and customization scenarios
  - Use Exa Search tool to understand real-world use cases and practical applications of packages for complex tasks
  - Focus research on understanding how packages work together in the context of the specific problem domain

## Documentation requirements
  - Extract and document package quick start guides and basic usage patterns
  - Research integration patterns showing how packages can work together effectively
  - Identify common customization scenarios and best practices
  - Capture API usage patterns, method signatures, and configuration requirements

## Knowledge management
  - Store all research findings in Knowledge Graph Memory using the Memory MCP server
  - Organize knowledge by package, integration patterns, and use cases
  - Maintain consistency in package usage across the codebase using stored knowledge
  - Reference stored knowledge for future tasks to ensure consistent implementation

## Integration patterns
  - Research how packages integrate with existing tech stack components
  - Document compatibility requirements and version dependencies
  - Identify potential integration challenges and solutions
  - Create integration templates and patterns for common use cases

## Implementation workflow
  - Research packages before any implementation begins
  - Store findings in knowledge graph for reference during development
  - Use stored knowledge to ensure consistent package usage patterns
  - Update knowledge graph with new insights and patterns discovered during implementation

## Quality assurance
  - Verify research findings against official documentation when possible
  - Cross-reference multiple sources for complex integration scenarios
  - Validate customization patterns against community best practices
  - Ensure research covers both basic usage and advanced customization options

## Long-term maintenance
  - Use knowledge graph as a living documentation system
  - Update stored knowledge when packages are updated or new patterns emerge
  - Reference stored knowledge for troubleshooting and debugging
  - Maintain consistency across projects using the same package patterns
